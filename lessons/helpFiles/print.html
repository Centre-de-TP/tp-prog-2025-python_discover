                In programming, it will be very useful for you to display text or
                elements on the computer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each line of code is an order that you give to the computer.
                <br>
                So in order to display something, you will have to write a code line which tell the computer to
                display the desired element.
                <br>
                <br>
                The magic thing to do that is the print.
                <br>
                But basically when you write your print, you tell the computer to display the thing between the
                parenthesis.
                <br>
                You can see an example below :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">print("Hello World")
>>> Hello World</div>
            <p>
                Here you tell the computer to display the sentence "Hello World".
                <br>
                <br>
                It's possible to write other things than sentences like in the example below :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">print(1001)
>>> 1001</div>
            <p>
                Here you tell the computer to display the number 1001.
                <br>
                <br>
                To go further with the print, it's possible to let the print create sentences with words you give.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">print("I'm", "a", "sentence")
>>> I'm a sentence</div>
            <p>
                Here you tell the computer to display the sentence "I'm a sentence" after building it.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the end of the lesson, don't forget to ask for help if you don't understand.
