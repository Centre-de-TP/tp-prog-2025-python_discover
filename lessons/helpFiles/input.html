            <p>
                When you do a program, you may have to ask the user for information (like a searched music for example).
                <br>
                <br>
                Remember that you need to tell the computer to ask the user an information.
                <br>
                <br>
                The magic thing to do that is the input function.
                <br>
                To make it simple, when you use your input function, you tell the computer to display the thing between
                the parenthesis to the user and to send you the information that the user gives you.
                <br>
                You can see an example below :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">input("What's your favorite music?")
>>></div>
            <p>
                Here you tell the computer to display the sentence "Ask the user for it favorite music".
                <br>
                <br>
                It's possible to ok other things than sentences like in the example below :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">input(1001)
>>></div>
            <p>
                Here you tell the computer to ask the user "1001".
                <br>
                But this thing doesn't have any sens, this is why it's not used.
                <br>
                <br>
                In difference with the print, an input function accepts only one element between the parenthesis.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">input("Tell", "me", "something")
>>> Error: TypeError: input() takes at most 1 arguments (3 given) on line 1</div>
            <p>
                To understand the error, the thing you write between the parenthesis are called arguments.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before ending the lesson, you can use the result given by the user if you want to.
                <br>
                As shown in the next exemple, you just have to use the piece of code like if it already was the user response.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">print(input("Tell me your favorite music."))
>>> Believers from Imagine Dragons</div>
            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the end of the lesson, don't forget to ask for help if you don't understand.
