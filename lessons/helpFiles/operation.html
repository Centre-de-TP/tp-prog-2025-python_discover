                Here is the time when Mathematics enter the programming language.
                <br>
                <br>
                In python, there is a lot of operation which exists and allow the user to do a lot of things.
                <br>
                First, you should be familiar with the integer operations.

            <p>
                But now that you have seen the types, let's introduce some more complex operations.
                <br>
                First, the division may give you a floating number even if it's applied between two integers.
                <br>
                So in programming we designed other operations to prevent from that.

                    <tr>
                        <td>Integer Division</td>

            <p>
                To understand properly the integer division, you may have seen earlier in school when you where
                learning about the division, what is the rest in a division.
                <br>
                Until now, you always put the rest after the "," in your result.
                <br>
                But sometimes you may don't want the rest of the division, then you keep only the integer part of the
                result, the one before the ",".
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, in order to complete some operation more quickly, you will find more complexe operations.

                <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Operator Symbol</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                        <th>Result</th>

                        <td>1</td>
                    </tr>

            <p>
                Here you can see a really complexe operation called the "modulo".
                <br>
                The concept of this operation is similar to the concept of integer division.
                <br>
                When, in the integer division you keep the integer part of a result, in the opposite, when you use the
                modulo you keep the left part of the integer division.
                <br>
                <br>
                To re-explain the previous example, when we decompose the operation "7 % 2", it gives us "(2 * 3 + 1)
                % 2".
                <br>
                This is also the same as keeping every module of 2 in the parenthesis out and leaving the rest.
                <br>
                It then gives us "1" left and "2 * 3 / 2" which is an integer.
                <br>
                So the result is 1.
                <br>
                <br>
                But the operation works with most of the type system :
