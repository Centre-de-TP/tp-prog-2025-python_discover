            <p>
                We saw a bit earlier the different types which could exist in the language.
                <br>
                May be you remember seeing "True" once.
                <br>
                <br>
                Those values can be used to create a condition system.
                <br>
                Let's discover the boolean type and all the possible values.
            </p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Type</th>
                        <th>Value</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                        <th>Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>bool</td>
                        <td>True</td>
                        <td>1 == 1</td>
                        <td>This statement is a true statement, we now that 1 is equals to 1.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>bool</td>
                        <td>True</td>
                        <td>True</td>
                        <td>You can also directly use the "True" value without creating a correct truth expression.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>bool</td>
                        <td>False</td>
                        <td>1 != 1</td>
                        <td>On the other hand, 1 doesn't differ from 1 so this statement is incorrect.</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <p>
                As you can on the previous table, there is in python a type which represent the truth value of a given
                statement.
                <br>
                And before you ask, YES it is possible to print the value of this statement.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">print(1 != 1)
>>> False
print(type(1 != 1))
>>> bool</div>
            <p>
                But as you could see, in programming we don't have all the mathematics symbols.
                <br>
                Therefore, we have to replace the symbols with the symbols we had.
                <br>
                As well, some symbols like the "=" were already taken for other operations (here the variable creation).
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's see some examples :
            </p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table class="table">

                        <th>Operator Symbol</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                        <th>Result</th>
                        <th>Second Example</th>
                        <th>Result</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>

            <br>
            <h3 class="underline">The condition checker</h3>
            <p>
                But you will ask "Why these things can be used for ?".
                <br>
                It's the time to introduce the conditions.
                <br>
                In programming, it could be a great thing to check if a value is correct before engaging another action.
                <br>
                <br>
                Example :
                <br>
                Imagine a situation where I have a number and if the number is odd, I want to write "odd", otherwise I
                should write "even".
                <br>
                To check if a number is odd, we have seen the modulo earlier which will help us a lot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is an example :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The chosen number is " + str(number))

if (number % 2 == 0) :
    print("The number is even")
else :
    print("The number is odd")</div>
            <p>
                In the previous example we used two very important thing in python.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first one is the use of a condition checker.
                <br>
                This will execute the actions within a given "scope" if the condition is true.
                <br>
                Two checker were used here.
                <br>
                The first one is an "if" statement which will execute the scope if the condition is true.
                <br>
                The second is an "else" statement which will execute the scope if the previous "if" condition isn't
                true.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second very important thing is the scope definition.
                <br>
                In python when an action depend on a previous line, it's mandatory to add a space right after it.
                <br>
                In the previous example, the print("The number is even") depend on the if statement.
                <br>
                This is used when the previous line ends with the symbol ":".
                <br>
                <br>
                You will use some different condition checker from now one.
                <br>
                Let's see them :
            </p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Statement Name</th>
                        <th>Construction</th>
                        <th>Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>if statement</td>
                        <td>if (condition) :</td>
                        <td>If the condition between the parenthesis is valid, the scope is executed.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>elif statement</td>
                        <td>elif (condition) :</td>
                        <td>If the previous "elif" and "if" 's condition weren't True and the condition between the
                            parenthesis is valid, the scope is executed.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>else statement</td>
                        <td>else :</td>
                        <td>If the previous "elif" and "if" 's condition weren't True, the scope is executed.</td>
                    </tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 class="underline">More complex conditions</h3>
            <p>
                Because we don't want the dev to write a lot of "if" statement when there is a complex condition to
                check, we have added a very useful thing to the language.*
                <br>
                It's easy to say when a human is talking to another human that :
                <br>
                "he did something, and he did another thing".
                <br>
                <br>
                In programming, it's the same.
            </p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table class="table">
                    <thead>

                        <td>OR</td>

            </div>
            <p>
                If you want to go further, it's also possible to add parenthesis to create very complex conditions.
                <br>
                But for now let's have an example of these new statements.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter a second number: "))
print("The chosen numbers are : " + str(number) + " and " + str(number2))

sum = number + number2
print("The sum is : " + str(sum))

if (2 * number == sum and 2 * number2 == sum) :
    print("The sum is the double of both numbers !")
elif (2 * number == sum or 2 * number2 == sum) :
    print("The sum is the double of one number only")
elif (not number == sum) :
    print("The sum which isn't the double of number, isn't equals to it either.")</div>
            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the end of the lesson, don't forget to ask for help if you don't understand.
