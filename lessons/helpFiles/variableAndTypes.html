            <p>
                Variables are a way to keep thing in memory for a program.
                <br>
                Imagine a simple program where you ask the user which is his favourite music so you can launch it for
                him.
                <br>
                Then a possible way of using variables could be to store the user response into one variable and once
                you need to launch the music, you take out the variable to search for the correct music on internet.
                <br>
                <br>
                A variable can be seen as a box where you can put every kind of things and just re-use these things
                when you need to.
                <br>
                To find these boxes in the big box storage which is your computer, you need to put a tag on the box.
                <br>
                It's called the variable name.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can see an example below :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">favouriteMusic = input("What's your favorite music?")
print(favouriteMusic)
>>> Believers from Imagine Dragons</div>
            <p>
                I hope you remember the input function we saw earlier.
                <br>
                Now we added a variable to store the user response.
                <br>
                Then the variable can be re-used with the print function so you can display the result.
                <br>
                <br>
                This example showed us the way of storing a user input but you can also store objects in a variable.
                <br>
                Let's say that we want to store the artist name directly into the code without asking the user :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">favouriteAuthor = "Imagine Dragons"
print(favouriteAuthor)
>>> Imagine Dragons</div>
            <p>
                To go a bit further with variables, it's possible to variable, which store copies of other variables.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">favouriteAuthor = "Imagine Dragons"
copy = favouriteAuthor
print(favouriteAuthor)
print(copy)
>>> Imagine Dragons
Imagine Dragons</div>
            <p>
                As said previously, a variable can store any kind of object in python.
                <br>
                We saw how to store sentences but let's see if I want to store a number :
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">famousNumber = "42"
print("The answer of life is ", famousNumber)
>>> The answer of life is 42</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h1 class="underline">The "Comments"</h1>
    <div class="center-left">
        <div class="column">
            <p>
                Another useful thing to structure code is the comments.
                <br>
                They are represented by the symbole "#" and the purpose of the comments are just to explain the user
                what is happening.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">#This line isn't useful at all
famousNumber = 42
print("The answer of life is ", famousNumber)
>>> The answer of life is 42</div>
            <p>
                As you could see previously, the comment didn't change the code behaviour at all.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h1 class="underline">The "Types"</h1>
    <div class="center-left">
        <div class="column">
            <p>
                Let's now introduce the object type.
                <br>
                In python, and in programmation in general we often manipulate object.
                <br>
                But each object has his own type, and you can have nested types in some programming languages.
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, since the beginning of the tutorial you are using sentences which in programming are
                called "string".
                <br>
                A lot of other types exists but for now let's concentrate on the principals ones.
                <br>
            </p>
            <div class="code-block"># Primordial types
print(type(42)) #The integer number are called int.
>>> int

print(type(42.5)) #The number with a comma (or in programming with a dot) are called float.
>>> float

print(type("text")) #The texts are called string (written str).
>>> str

print(type("42.5")) #The double quote are used to create a text.
>>> str</div>
            <p>
                As you could see, a function "type" can be used to see the object type.
                <br>
                Regarding the variables, their type is the type of the held object.
                <br>
                If the held object change, the variable type also change.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">my_variable = 42
print(type(my_variable))
>>> int

my_variable = 42
my_variable = 42.5
print(type(my_variable))
>>> float</div>
            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the end of the lesson, don't forget to ask for help if you don't understand.
